*Unfortunately DarkSky has ceased giving out developer keys for their API after their Apple acquisition. This means this project is retired. A possible future iteration can be developed with a new client for weather information. I may return to this fun project in the future. Sorry for the inconvenience.*

~~Only tested with macOS Catalina with Java 8 (update 231). Source files with code will be added later on. To run application simply run RunWeatherApp.sh and register with Dark Sky API key & OpenCage Geocoder API key with a location name or coordinates of your choosing.~~
